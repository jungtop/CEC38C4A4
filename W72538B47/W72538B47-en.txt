Prayer for the Long Life of Lochen Ngawang Chöpal by the Fifth Dalai Lama
May the sunlight of compassion from Ngayab Lingpa,
Who embodies all the victorious buddhas, bring an end
To the darkness of ancestral deities and may the sublime light
Of the happiness and benefit of immortality fill the three realms!
Skilled exponent of the vast, oceanic scriptural tradition
Of sūtra and mantra, a lord of speech with mastery
Over the glory of explication, debate and composition—
Sole eye for the world, may your life remain secure for a hundred aeons!
May the oceanic hosts of yidam deities—the eight great sādhanas,
Gönpo Maning blazing in glory and the rest—and dharma guardians
Utterly pacify any demons afflicting this vidyādhara lord of Dharma
And ensure that his life is as stable as the everlasting yungdrung!
As requested by the Dharma practitioner Ngawang Trinlé, who expressed a need for a longevity prayer for Lochen Ngawang Chöpal, this was composed by the monk of Zahor. The scribe was Neten Jamyang Drakpa. | Translated by Adam Pearcey, 2019.
